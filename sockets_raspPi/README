# Recommendations for server.py
- To ensure smooth operation of server.py, please follow these recommendations:

1. Hardware Requirements:

Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 is required for running the server.
2. File Placement:

Copy the server.py file to the /home/ directory on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Dataset Location:

Make sure the input dataset file (in .csv format) is placed in the same directory as server.py.
4. Dependencies Installation:

Install all the necessary dependencies to run the code with Python 3.0. Ensure that you have installed the required packages.
5. Network Configuration:

Ensure that the Raspberry Pi is connected to the same network as the client receiver. This is important for establishing communication between the server and the client.
6. Time Sleep Adjustment:

Adapt the time sleep in the code according to your requirements. Make sure that the time interval is not set to less than 5 seconds. Adjust the value as needed to meet your specific needs.
7. Port Connection:

Connect to port 5000 when establishing a connection with the server. Make sure that the client application is configured to connect to port 5000 for communication with the server.
